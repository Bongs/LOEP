# LOEP (Learning Object Evaluation Platform)

LOEP is an open source web platform developed using Ruby on Rails that aims to facilitate the evaluation of small and self-contained web educational resources, known as Learning Objects, in different scenarios and educational settings by providing a set of tools and technologies and supporting and integrating several evaluation models and quality metrics.  

LOEP can provide Learning Object evaluation to e-Learning systems in an open, low cost, reliable and effective way.
Repositories of educational resources can use LOEP to implement quality control policies and to enhance search services and recommender systems. 

The last releases can be seen [here](https://github.com/agordillo/LOEP/releases), and the future features and ongoing developments are shown on this [page](https://github.com/agordillo/LOEP/milestones).

  * Automatically using differeht matching stategies:
    * Prioritize workload balancing with random matching 
    * Prioritize workload balancing with best-effort matching
    * Prioritize reviewer suitability
* Support of several Learning Object evaluation models (as well as general purpose evaluation models)
  * LORI (Learning Object Review Instrument)
  * LOEM (Learning Object Evaluation Metric)
  * WBLT-S (WBLT Evaluation Scale for Students)
  * WBLT-T (WBLT Evaluation Scale for Teachers)
  * Metadata Quality evaluation model (automatic)
  * SUS (System Usability Scale)
* Support for automatic evaluation models and human reviews
* Support of several Learning Object quality metrics (as well as general purpose quality metrics)
  * AM (Arithmetic Mean) Metric for all evaluation models
  * WAM (Weighted Arithmetic Mean) Metric for all evaluation models
  * Additional metrics for LORI: Pedagogical, Technical, Orthogonal, Logarithmic, Square Root, ...
  * Metadata Quality metrics: Overall metadata quality, Completeness, Coherence, Conformance, Consistency and Findability.
  * SUS (System Usability Scale) score

* Support for defining and adding new quality metrics
* Evaluation reports, scores, statistics and graphs
* Evaluations and reports can be exported to excel files
* Learning Object Quality comparison and aggregated statistics
* API for connecting LOEP with e-Learning systems:
  * Learning Object API: allows to register and update Learning Objects.
  * Notifications: allows the e-Learning system to be notified of updates in the Learning Objects (new evaluations, updates of quality scores, etc).
* The same LOEP instance can be used to provide evaluation services to several e-Learning systems (with some constraints).
